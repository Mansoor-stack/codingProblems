# Coding Problems

This directory contains solutions to various coding problems and explorations of Java concepts, focusing on algorithms, data structures, core Java features, and problem-solving techniques.

## Files and Concepts Covered

Below is a list of the solution files and the key concepts or problem types they address:

*   **`Hackerrank/Scanner/ScannerConcept.java`**: Demonstrates reading various data types (String, int, float) from console input using `java.util.Scanner`. Covers `next()`, `nextLine()`, `nextInt()`, `nextFloat()`, and handling newline characters.
*   **`RoughNote/EqualsVsDoubleEquals.java`**: Explains and contrasts the use of `==` (reference/primitive value comparison) and `.equals()` (content comparison) for primitives and String objects (including String pool vs. heap).
*   **`Leetcode/ArrayElementCountInObject.java`**: Uses a `HashMap` to efficiently count the frequency of each element in an integer array. Demonstrates `map.getOrDefault()`.
*   **`RoughNote/Coffee.java`**: Illustrates the difference between `static` (class-level) and instance (object-level) variables and methods in Java, and how to access them.
*   **`RoughNote/ClassA.java`**: Shows the use of a `static` variable within a constructor to track state across all instances of a class (e.g., counting object creations).
*   **`Leetcode/ValidAnagram242.java`**: Solves LeetCode 242. Checks if two strings are anagrams by comparing character frequency counts using `HashMap`.
*   **`RoughNote/IteratorTopic.java`**: Demonstrates using `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, and the `Iterator` interface for traversing collections and safely removing elements during iteration (`itr.remove()`).
*   **`RoughNote/StringCyclicRotation.java`**: Implements logic to generate and print all cyclic rotations of a given string using `substring()` and concatenation.
*   **`RoughNote/ListIteratorTopic.java`**: Explores the `ListIterator` interface for bidirectional traversal (`hasNext()`, `hasPrevious()`) and modification (`set()`) of elements within a `LinkedList`.
*   **`Leetcode/MajorityElement169.java`**: Solves LeetCode 169. Finds the element appearing more than n/2 times in an array using a basic nested loop counting approach.

## Notes

*   Files are primarily written in Java.
*   The `RoughNote` directory contains exploratory code snippets for understanding specific Java concepts.
*   The `Leetcode` and `Hackerrank` directories contain solutions related to specific platform problems.
